# mini-projects
Very simple mini-projects written in Rust

The file inside of the temperature-converter folder (main.rs) is a very simple temperature converter written in Rust, in which the user can specify if they want to convert to celsius from fahrenheit or vice versa. The user can then enter the value they want to convert and the program converts that value and returns the converted value.

The file inside of the nth-fibo-num-gen folder (main.rs) is a very simple Fibonacci sequnece number generator, which takes an nth number specified by the user and finds the value at that nth number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The file inside of the square-maker folder (main.rs) is a very simple program, which takes a value from the user (width or height) and creates a square with that value as the width and height (assigns it to its own struct instance [sq1]). It then calculates and returns the area of that square.
